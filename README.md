# QuoteTwitterBot
Scrapes the maximum number of available tweets from the @CodeWisdom Twitter account and stores them in a text document. Every subsequent execution of the program will scrape all the new tweets since last scraping. With the tweet data in the text document, tweets are generated using Markov Chains and posted to a Twitter bot account. 

**Example Account**: https://twitter.com/CodeWisdomBot
